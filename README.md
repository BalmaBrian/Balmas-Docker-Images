# Balmas-Docker-Images

A collection of my Docker images I use for personal development or school. The current list of Docker Images are:

- neovim-base: Ubuntu install of neovim with some extra packages.
- spacevim-base: This is a collection of diffrent docker files that build a SpaceVim enviorment in 6 diffrent linux distrabutions.

# Building from scratch

If you are on a windows system, run the build.bat script to build all the docker containers in order. If you are on a linux system, run the build.sh to build all the docker containers in order.
